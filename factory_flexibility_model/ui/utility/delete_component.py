# FUNCTIONS
def delete_selected_component(app):
    """
    This function deletes the component that is currently selected within the app.
    The component to be deleted is defined through the current entry of app.selected_asset.
    Deleting the component consists of three steps:

    1) At first, the function goes through all connections within app.blueprint.connections and deletes all instances that involve the selected component as origion or destination.

    2) The selected component might already have some parameters defined within app.session_data["parameters"]. If there is a key for the component in this dict, the entry is being removed

    3) The component itself is being deleted from app.blueprint.components

    Finally the GUI is resettet by setting app.selected_asset to None, calling the welcome screen on the right side and calling app.initialize_visualization() to redraw the system layout without the deleted component

    :param app: Pointer to the main factory_GUIApp-Object
    :return: None
